# NYT-CopyRE

The NYT relation extraction dataset consists of automatic alignments between New York Times articles and Freebase relations.
This version of the dataset, produced by the authors of CopyRE, contains 24 relation types in its annotations.
Freebase isn't around anymore, but in its place we provide a few schemas for this dataset (**WIP**):

- `schema_org.json` (**TODO**) matches each Freebase relation type with the nearest [schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) schema.

- [`schema_perplexity.json`](./schema_perplexity.json) with some guesses at descriptions for all 24 relations, [generated by Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/write-a-short-single-sentence-1OB99aerSc6Zq25P5mbDMg#0).

- [`schema_wikidata.json`](./schema_wikidata.json) uses the [Freebase-Wikidata mappings](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Freebase/Mapping) and Perplexity search to find the closest Wikidata relations, if any, to each of the Freebase relation types.
  Care must be taken, because Perplexity (including Perplexity Pro) seems to hallucinate sometimes.
  Some Freebase relations have no Wikidata equivalent, so they are dropped from this schema.
