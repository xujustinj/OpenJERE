This fork of [`WindChimeRan/OpenJERE`](https://github.com/WindChimeRan/OpenJERE) has been reduced to a minimal reproduction of the Seq2UMTree model introduced in the above paper.

The original repository contains the code for comparing Seq2UMTree against several baselines, but the abstractions involved make it a bit hard to understand the model on its own.
Here, we remove all code paths unrelated to Seq2UMTree and lightly refactor for readability, including clearer variable names and type annotations.
